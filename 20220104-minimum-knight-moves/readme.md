# Minimum knight moves

Given a chess board of `n` by `n` squares, the starting position of a knight and a target position, find the minimum number of moves the knight must make to reach its target.

A knight moves 2 steps along one axis and 1 step along the perpendicular axis. e.g from (4, 4) knight can move to (6, 5), (6, 3), (2, 6) and so on.

If the same is not possible, return `-1`.
