# Even-odd list

You're given a singly linked list as input. Group all the odd nodes together followed by all the even nodes. By odd nodes we're referring to the node number and not the value in the node!

```sh
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->None

Output: 1->3->5->2->4->None
```

Do this in-place with `O(1)` space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.
