# Zeroing lines

You're given an N x N matrix where some of the items in the matrix are 0. If any of the items are 0, then set the item's entire row and column to 0. Items that are not 0 will be represented by an integer.

```sh
Input - [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,0,7,8],
  [6,1,1,2],
  [2,3,4,0]
]
Output - [
  [1,0,3,0],
  [0,0,0,0],
  [6,0,1,0],
  [0,0,0,0]
]
```
