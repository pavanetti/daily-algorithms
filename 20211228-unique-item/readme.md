# Unique item

Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer, which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.

```sh
Input - [6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6]

Output - 1

Input - [13, 19, 13, 13]

Output - 19
```

Do this in-place with `O(1)` space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.
