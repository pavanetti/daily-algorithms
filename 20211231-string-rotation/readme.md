# String rotation

You are given two strings as input. Write a function to check if one string is a rotation of the other string. An example of a rotation is

"CodingInterview", "erviewCodingInt"

You will also be given a function isSubstring that will return a boolean that is True if one string is a substring of the other. You can only call this function once.
