# Group anagrams

You're given an array of strings as input. The strings will only contain lowercase letters from a-z. Group all the anagrams in the array together and return the resulting array. An anagram is a word that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

```sh
Input: ["yx", "abe", "act", "eab", "x", "eba", "tca", "xy"]

Output: [
  ["abe", "eab", "eba"],
  ["act", "tca"],
  ["xy", "yx"],
  ["x"]
]
```
